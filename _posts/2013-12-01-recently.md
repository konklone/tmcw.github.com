## Watching

<span class='image-credit'>Cuyahoga Falls in Ohio</span>

* [Spring Breakers](http://www.springbreakersmovie.com/) was incredible and as a result I got [Everytime](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7n3gF7j2V4) stuck in my head for a few days.
* Attempted to watch [Frogs](http://bit.ly/1cJYnLN), but only got halfway there. Worst film so far.
* Watched both the first and second Hunger Games movies in the span of two days.

## Listening

* [PJ Harvey - Let England Shake](http://www.spin.com/reviews/pj-harvey-let-england-shake-vagrant/)
* [Floex - Zorya](http://store.floex.cz/album/zorya)
* Teen Mom played a show at [Galaxy Hut](http://www.galaxyhut.com/) with [Breakfast in Fur](http://breakfastinfur.com/), our labelmates on [Analog Edition](http://analogedition.com/). They are great.

## Outside

I ran the [Run for the Parks 10k](http://www.prraces.com/theparks10k/) again and
improved my time last year by 30 seconds.

[Jue](https://twitter.com/jue_yang) and [Derek](https://twitter.com/dereklieu) held [thxgoat](http://thxgoat.com/), a wonderful friendsgiving celebration that included a goat roast in a reused porcelain bathtub.

I finally finished building my [Bleep Drum](http://bleeplabs.com/store/the-bleep-drum/). I soldered a capacitor in on the wrong side, extracted it, and then soldered it in on the wrong side again. The final product includes some creative rewiring.

I've been tinkering with [mapschool](http://macwright.org/mapschool/), a non-textbook for geographic concepts. The [MapBox.js JS docs](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js/blob/master/JS.md) attempt to handle the more technical side. I'm gearing up to teach an intersession class at [Millbrook School](http://www.millbrook.org/), where my sister leads the art department.
