February flew by.

Finally developed the last roll out of my Olympus 35RC of photos from New Years.

I skied for the first time. Only 'green' slopes thus far and no major injuries. Lots of fun.

I presented with Noah Veltman on [principles](http://www.macwright.org/presentations/nicar/#0) and [mistakes](https://github.com/veltman/maps-nicar14) of web mapping. It was at [NICAR](http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/) in Baltimore, so a pleasant little day trip and good to catch up with friends from different spheres.

## Elsewhere

I wrote a [mapmaker cheatsheet](https://github.com/tmcw/mapmakers-cheatsheet) in prep for NICAR - it's the concrete & technical side of [mapschool](http://mapschool.io/), covering what specific techniques and tools work.

I wrote [mrchat](https://github.com/tmcw/mrchat), a minimal chat server and client, to help communications within a classroom this week. It's the deepest so far I've gone into the land of streams & browserify, and I walk away really sold on how modular composition makes it possible to do so much in [so little code](https://github.com/tmcw/mrchat/blob/master/server.js).
