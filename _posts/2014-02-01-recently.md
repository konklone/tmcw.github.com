Movies

* [The Master](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560747/)
* [Moon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/), which made me realize the
  born-into-unknown-life-of-work meme of Cloud Atlas, Matrix, THX 1138, and others.

Reading

[Democracy, English, and the Wars over Usage](http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/DFW_present_tense.html),
a piece by David Foster Wallace, absolutely won my heart this month. I read
it on a flight and by the time I landed everything I heard reminded me of it,
from the ideas on Politically Correct English to the fraught concept of
purely descriptive linguistics.

> This is [Politically Correct English]'s central fallacy â€” that a society's mode of expression is productive of its attitudes rather than a product of those attitudes

Everything in [Bret Victor's Links 2013](http://worrydream.com/Links2013/) is
worth a read.

[Clock of the Long Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33279.Clock_Of_The_Long_Now), on the
recommendation of [Mike Migurski](http://mike.teczno.com/). I think it could
have focused better on practical elements of design and planning rather than
the kind of vague question-asking that it got caught up in. It also makes a few
predictions about technology which went all wrong: Java taking over.
Motorola being a thousand-year company.

## San Francisco

I spent a week at Mapbox's new office in San Francisco, located on the top
floor of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/)'s building. It's a
pristine, hard wood floor type place filled with great people.

Being in SF also meant meeting a lot of twitter & internet friends - now real life friends,
running [Twin Peaks at sunrise](http://www.strava.com/activities/106333227), and drinking freshly squeezed carrot and ginger
juice on my walk from Corona Heights to SoMa each morning.

Next up I'm spending some time at [Millbrook School](http://www.millbrook.org/podium/default.aspx?t=132079)
co-teaching a class with [my sister](http://sarahmacwright.com/) about the internet
and programming.

## Elsewhere

* I did [an interview with geohipster](http://geohipster.com/2014/01/30/interview-with-tom-macwright-if-you-want-to-make-anything-new-you-have-to-ignore-some-of-the-rules/),
  talking about geo, work, music, and so on.
* We released versions [1.6.0](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapboxjs-v160/)
  and [1.6.1](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapboxjs-v161/) of mapbox.js, and
  finally made a [plugin CDN](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/extend-your-maps-mapboxjs-plugins/).
* Next up [Francisco Dans](https://twitter.com/fdans) and I are working on
  the long-awaited [Mapbox Android SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk)
* I'm still working on [mapschool](http://mapschool.io/), recently adding
  [a section on the shape of the Earth](http://mapschool.io/#the-shape-of-the-earth).
  Contributions keep coming in, and the potential of it becoming a central
  effort of people sharing expertise is huge.
