Movies

Music

* [The Can't Tells - No Television](http://thecanttells.com/) - Teen Mom played
  a show with these guys this month, and they really make the most of a three-piece
  in every way.

Reading

[Democracy, English, and the Wars over Usage](http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/DFW_present_tense.html),
a piece by David Foster Wallace, absolutely won my heart this month. I read
it on a flight and by the time I landed everything I heard reminded me of it,
from the ideas on Politically Correct English to the fraught concept of
purely descriptive linguistics.

## SF

I spent a week at Mapbox's new office in San Franscisco, located on the top
floor of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/)'s building. It's a
pristine, hard wood floor type place filled with great people.

Being in SF also meant meeting a lot of twitter & internet friends - now real life friends,
running twin peaks at sunrise, and drinking freshly squeezed carrot and ginger
juice on my walk from Corona Heights to SoMa each morning.

Next up I'm spending some time at [Millbrook School](http://www.millbrook.org/podium/default.aspx?t=132079)
co-teaching a class with [my sister](http://sarahmacwright.com/) about the internet
and programming.
