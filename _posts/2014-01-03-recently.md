A minor zeitgeist for an end-of-year post.

I got a new bike! A [Wabi Classic](http://www.wabicycles.com/classic_bike_spec_11.html),
in LB1B Yellow, fulfilling my promise of always only riding yellow bikes.
It's my first fixed gear, a total experience to ride every day.
Some [Bicibands](https://mollettadesign.com?affiliates=5) are in the mail to
swap out for cages - jumping on and off has been less than elegant recently.

## Year

This year I spoke less at conferences. It made me uneasy that my presence would
reduce diversity, and writing seems like a higher-throughput channel for talking tech -
there's a lower price of admission, I never stutter, and you can proof before you post.
Plus, I've never learned in a lecture setting, so giving lectures felt odd.

It was another year in DC. Mapbox's [San Francisco office](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/office-space-in-san-francisco/)
is now more than the few chairs at [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/)
so I'll probably be spending more time out there in the coming year. But
DC is still the center of gravity for my life, despite my gripes with the city-as-such.

This was my third year working full-time at MapBox (after two & a bit at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/)).
DS has a [new beginning](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/12/10/ian-schuler-to-lead-development-seed/) and
MapBox has [funding](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/10million-funding-foundry-group/) and
[tons of geniuses](https://www.mapbox.com/about/team/). I didn't expect to
'do maps' and still don't have any love for GIS and such. But the more I learn,
the more everything is connected.

I didn't record enough solo music this year.

[Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com/) released Gilly, our second album, and our friend Omar joined, and sadly, left, the band. We're scouting
out cabins or mountaintops to record a full-length album.

I ran about ~339 miles this year, and I want to run a lot more last year. A marathon
is probably too much, but another half-marathon would be good motivation.
600 miles seems like a reasonable goal.

I'm amazed that the DC Code struggle that I started posted about in
[February of 2013](http://macwright.org/2013/02/11/the-code-written.html)
was [nearly resolved by April](http://macwright.org/2013/04/16/dc-code-hackathon.html),
mostly thanks to superheroes like [David](https://twitter.com/vdavez),
[Carl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud), [Josh](http://razor.occams.info/),
and [Waldo](http://waldo.jaquith.org/). Hopefully when I have some time in 2014
I'll throw a bit more code into the ring to see where it can go.

I'm not sure where my interests will go this year: working on Mapbox keeps me
thinking about how best to build [the hammer](http://macwright.org/2013/09/05/buttons.html)
and personal projects slowly form the bounds of what I'd really _really_
like to do.
