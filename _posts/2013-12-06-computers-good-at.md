What Computers are Good At

What are computers good at? This question is core to a wide range of experience I've had, from doing freelance web design in high school to working with clients at Development Seed or describing how MapBox works. This understanding is the core of the relationship between 'implementers' and 'stakeholders' but is rarely discussed as itself: often a meeting will be a series of questions.

> So, can the software figure out which category our items should be in?

> Wow, so you can really search thousands of things that fast?

> Why can't we integrate with our existing service?

I hope that this is helpful at least in the abstract, though it can be tricky to cover every situation.
