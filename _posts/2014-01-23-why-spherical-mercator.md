Spherical Mercator, or Web Mercator is the most popular [map projection](http://www.macwright.org/2012/01/27/projections-understanding.html)
on the internet. Due to the cartographic flaws of the projection,
it's a popular target for criticism: everyone from [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/07/projection-mercator/)
to [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/977/) have made light of Greenland's size and so on.

Unfortunately almost no commentators have considered why Mercator is popular
despite its flaws and why it continues to be popular in the internet.

> When there are so many other projections to chose from, why is it that today the Mercator projection is still such a widely recognized image used to represent the globe? The answer may be simply convention or habit. The inertia of habit is a powerful force.

We know the answer: here it is.
