[Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com/)'s new
[album is on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/gilly-ep/id735672158?uo=4),
[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) got [funded](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/10million-funding-foundry-group/)
and hired some [cool](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/sean-gillies-joins-mapbox/)
[folks](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/vladimir-agafonkin-joins-mapbox/). I
went to the Poconos again and shot guns again. I [made a thing to render 3D](http://macwright.org/literate-raytracer/),
and worked mostly on a [geocoding project](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen).

My mind is a little bit everywhere. I'm dying to understand entropy, quaternions,
and raster format internals.

## Listening

Recently, it's been a ton of hip-hop and rap. I'm not sure whether it's because
of a few hit albums recently or great recommendations from friends,
or the [RapGenius](http://rapgenius.com/) way of listening.
