[**mapschool** is an educational project about maps.](http://macwright.org/mapschool/)
In modern-day terms, it's about GIS, cartography, and a bit of everything else.

It's for teaching people how the earth and its stuff becomes data and how that data
turns into pictures and ideas.

I hope that it's a
complementary piece to technical literature that empowers people to
think critically about tools and techniques.

mapschool was inspired by frustration with existing learning materials. The
field of GIS is cursed by being both product and discipline:
[Esri](http://www.esri.com/) and others popularized techniques and terms
related to doing things with geospatial data, which is a benefit.
But in this process they branded basic ideas and turned education that could
be engaging and creative into rote memorization of products and terms.

So the centerpoint of mapschool is generality and creativity. No products,
no unthinking acceptance of principles. It's a massive challenge and
is far away still, but I believe in it.

It's an attempt to explore the space of 'textbooks' on the internet,
combining the style of blogs, Wikipedia, and traditional
print. Hyperlinks and interactive demos are deemphasized: interaction
will be flat, to fit the secret plan.

The secret plan is to print mapschool, and to figure out how to make it
as simple and cheap as possible. It should explore the other corner of price
and attitude as a textbook.

There's still space to explore. Should there be 'in-depth' sections for
each paragraph? Would this make sense as a weekly email series, and does
the ebook version matter? How would translations be created and maintained?

The current highest priority is to solicit feedback from people for whom it is
an introductory text, to find gaps in explanations and unanswered
questions. That's because it's impossible for people with deep experience to read
as if they don't have it.

Education needs to stop sucking, and
this is a first shot at doing that on a larger scale. There are other promising
initiatives like [CartoDB academy](http://cartodb.com/academy) on the applied
side, and a few great resources like [Furuti's guide to map projections](http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/TOC/cartTOC.html).

If you've got something
to improve or add, [it's an open data project](https://github.com/tmcw/mapschool)
