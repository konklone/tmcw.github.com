Two years ago, I asked on Stack Exchange ['Why are Data Projections Relevant?'](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/16251/why-are-data-projections-relevant).

This came to mind again in December and I tweeted:

> projected gis data is a bad idea and it's disappointing that people unthinkingly continue to make it.

This resulted in [an interesting thread of responses](https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/414904996296019968),
ranging from 'you have no idea what you're talking about' to near-agreement.

This idea deserves more than a tweet: what does projected data mean, when is it
useful, and what could be next?
